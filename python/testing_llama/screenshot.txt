PETALING JAYA: Sarawak premier Abang Johari Openg reveals that a solution has been reached Special Features
over the dispute between Sarawak and Petronas over the rights to oil and gas (0&G) resources in
and around the state, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim set to announce it soon.

Abang Johari said the matter could now be considered resolved, pending the official
announcement.

“In fact, the solution is already in sight. I cannot disclose it at this moment, but the prime
minister will share the formula with us. It is settled,” he said during an interview on TVSarawak.

He said the issue was merely a legal matter, with Petronas relying on the Petroleum
Development Act 1974 (PDA) and Sarawak on the Oil and Mining Ordinance 1958 (OMO).

“It has been decided (that the rights of both parties) under the PDA and OMO can coexist,” he
added.

Over the past year, Sarawak has pressed hard for Petronas to ink a deal that would make «< >
Petroleum Sarawak Bhd (Petros) the sole gas aggregator in the state.

Last month, Abang Johari refuted suggestions that his state was acting greedily, saying it was
merely exercising a “constitutional right” to distribute gas which belongs to the state.

He had previously said Sarawak was prepared to battle any party that “disrespects” its “rights” in
a court of law.

Abang Johari today said some had exaggerated claims suggesting Petronas could lose up to
RM100 billion with Petros entering the fray for rights to the O&G resources in and around the

state.

“Yes, there may be a slight reduction (to Petronas’s profits) due to the gas distribution
arrangement, but I believe this can be resolved,” he said.

He also stated that Sarawak’s state-owned oil and gas company would continue collaborating
with Petronas in the gas industry within the region.

He explained that the partnership between Petros and Petronas were necessary as collectively,
they dominate a significant portion of Sarawak’s gas reserves.
